We are exposing a limited number of read-only APIs at the moment. Click on the endpoints on the left to view the OpenAPI specification file.

## Authentication

You'll need to send your access token with each request. To obtain an access token, you'll need to send your base64 encoded username/password to the `/auth/token` endpoint. For example:

```bash
curl -x POST \
     -H "Authorization: Basic <username:password|base64>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     /auth/token
```

Send the access token in the `Authorization` header. For example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>" \
     -H "Variable-Company: <company_uuid>" \
     /v1/activity
```
