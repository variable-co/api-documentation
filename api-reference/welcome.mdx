A set of read-only endpoints to access your Variable data.

<Accordion title="Authentication">
    You'll need to send your access token with each request. To obtain an access token, you'll need to send your base64 encoded username/password to the `/auth/token` endpoint. For example:

    ```bash
    curl -x POST \
         -H "Authorization: Basic <username:password|base64>" \
         -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
         -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
         /auth/token
    ```

    Send the access token in the `Authorization` header. For example:

    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
         -H "Variable-Company: <company_uuid>" \
         /v1/activity
    ```
</Accordion>
