A set of read-only endpoints to access your Variable data.

<Accordion title="Authentication">
    You'll need to send an access token with each request. To obtain an access token, send your base64
    encoded username/password to the `/auth/token` endpoint:

```bash
curl -x POST \
     -H "Authorization: Basic <username:password|base64>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
     -d "grant_type=client_credentials" \
     /auth/token
```

    Send the access token in the `Authorization` header. For example:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" \
     -H "Variable-Company: <company_uuid>" \
     /v1/activity
```
</Accordion>
