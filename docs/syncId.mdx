title: Sync ID
---

Products, Materials, Inputs and Activities have a `syncId` property that is used as an external identifier for the
object in Variable. This is useful for linking objects in Variable to objects in other systems, such as an ERP system.

The `syncId` is a string that can be set to any value, and it must be unique. If you have a Product or Material with a `syncId` of `123`,
you cannot create another Product or Material with the same `syncId`.
If you try to create a Product or Material with a `syncId` that already exists, you will get a `400 BadRequest` error.

The `syncId` is not used for any calculations or logic in Variable; its only purpose is to link objects in different systems together.
