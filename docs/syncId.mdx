title: Sync ID
---

All objects have a `syncId` property that is used as an external identifier of the thing in Variable.
This is useful for identifying objects in Variable by the ID of the object in another system, such as ERP software.

The `syncId` is a string that can be set to any value, and it must be unique. If you have a Product or Material with a `syncId` of `123`,
you cannot create another Product or Material with the same `syncId`.
If you try to create a Product or Material with a `syncId` that already exists, you will get a `400 BadRequest` error.
