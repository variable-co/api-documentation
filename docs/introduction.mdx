This is your guide to using the Variable API.

## Pre-requisites
1. You need to have a Variable account. If you don't already have one, you can [join the waitlist](https://app.variable.global/waitlist).
2. You need to have an API User with an API Key. Account admins can manage API Users in [users](https://app.variable.global/users).

## Try it out
You can use our [Postman](https://www.postman.com/variable-global/variable-api/overview) collection to try it out.

We also have some [example scripts in GitHub](https://github.com/variable-co/api-documentation/tree/main/examples).

## Further reading
Read about our [Data Model](/docs/data-model) to understand how all the pieces fit together.

Then check out our [REST API](/api-reference/welcome) to see how you can interact with the data.
