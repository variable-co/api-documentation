This is your guide to using the Variable API.

## Pre-requisites
1. You need to have a Variable account. If you don't already have one, you can [join the waitlist](https://app.variable.global/waitlist).

### API Access
There are two ways to get access:
1. You can use an API Key attached to an API User (which can be managed in [users](https://app.variable.global/users)).
2. You can use your normal user and the company specific API URL (which can be found in [company settings](https://app.variable.global/company)).

## Try it out
You can use our [Postman](https://www.postman.com/jimmybyrum/workspace/variable-api/collection/8239021-99a3c7bf-e833-4804-ad0a-302a8a28dc43?action=share&creator=8239021) collection to try it out.

We also have some [example scripts in GitHub](https://github.com/variable-co/api-documentation/tree/main/examples).

## Further reading
Read about our [Data Model](/docs/data-model) to understand how all the pieces fit together.

Then check out our [REST API](/api-reference/welcome) to see how you can interact with the data.
