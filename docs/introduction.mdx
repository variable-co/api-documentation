This is your guide to using the Variable API.

## Pre-requisites
1. You need to have a Variable account. If you don't already have one, you can [join the waitlist](https://app.variable.global/waitlist).
2. You need to know your account API URL _or_ UUID. Both can be found in [Company Settings](https://app.variable.global/company).
3. You need an API user. You can create one in [Users](https://app.variable.global/company/users).

## Try it out
