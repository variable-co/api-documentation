    **Only footprints that are valid according to the PACT standard will show in the API, regardless of the sharing
    setting.**

    This generally means footprints that have all of the required fields filled out.
    Details on the PACT standard and required fields can be found [in the PACT
    documentation](https://wbcsd.github.io/data-exchange-protocol/v2).
